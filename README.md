Patchlist:
-----

### v0.03: A few changes for Unique swords and blades.
Flangil: +9000 HP

Drigonlay: Fire attack element.

Fendus: No longer boosts HP, but instead increases defence better.

Castram: Now slashes and stabs

The Butcher - major damage, KB and KBpower boost

Tatepon's sword - 15% shield evasion, generally more OP than any other sword.

Tsuyugiri: Now makes you fly over battlefield in a blink of an eye. Still breaks shields as great. Tumble immune.

Murapata: Overpowered crits, sleep and poison.

Blade of Astria: Damage bonuses against certain enemies are majorly boosted.

Tsukigiri: Lightning-fast attacks, also recieved a damage buff. 100% shieldbreaker. Is now overpowered, but way too simple to use.

### v0.02: These setskills are lost in time and space:
Peerless Deer;
Peerless Bovine;
Peerless Tree;
Peerless Mushroom;
Peerless Penguin;
Peerless Dragon;
Peerless Bow;
Flash Shower;
 - you still can abuse MushroomRat, but it's a short-term and known bug.

###  v0.01: Welcome the new memes!

Caladbong: is replaced with Halo Former Greatsword with extreme accuracy in its stats. Inspired by a wretched japanese dude.
 - Isn't it the first thing that should be implemented? For the sake of memes! https://yadi.sk/i/vzLY4spRFeAiEg
Flangil:   Added Light attack element. Does no longer depend on its +level. HP and Damage bonus against demons and undead is gradually boosted.
 - ALL Unique and Super-Unique items are going to lose their dependance from +levels, and therefore I'm much simplyfying my balancing work and your farming process at VS.
