v0.0.1:
###  Caladbong: is replaced with Halo Former Greatsword with extreme accuracy in its stats. Inspired by a wretched japanese dude.
 - Isn't it the first thing that should be implemented? For the sake of memes! https://yadi.sk/i/vzLY4spRFeAiEg
###  Flangil:   Added Light attack element. Does no longer depend on its +level. HP and Damage bonus against demons and undead is gradually boosted.
 - ALL Unique and Super-Unique items are going to lose their dependance from +levels, and therefore I'm much simplyfying my balancing work and your farming process at VS.
